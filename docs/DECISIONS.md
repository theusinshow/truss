# Decisions

## 2026-07-27 - Testable local settings in API routes

FastAPI routes that touch persistence receive `Settings` through dependency injection.

Rationale:

- production uses the default local `data/` directory;
- tests can override the dependency with a temporary data directory;
- persistence behavior can be verified without polluting `data/db/truss.sqlite`;
- this keeps the app local-first and avoids adding a heavier migration/runtime layer before it is needed.

This does not change the architectural decisions in `AGENTS.md`: the backend remains FastAPI, SQLite remains the initial database, and PDFs/renders stay on disk.
